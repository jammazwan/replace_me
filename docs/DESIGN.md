btrg file manager
high level objectives
    save me time
    get stuff done that I otherwise wouldn't get done
    maintain organizational integrity/congruence
        functions
            like testing and CI/CD
        structure
            like standards that I forget without help
        focus
            like stray projects that I lose track of
        repository/index
            like backups and whiteboards and cross-media references
        enforcement
            like minimum tweets, reminders when tasks not complete
how to accomplish
    walks specified directories called workspaces
        within workspaces, files and projects
    takes in data about specific files
    generates either
        tasks that need to completed manually such as commits
        actual work completion such as missing Jenkinsfile
    assumes
        tighter
            consistency and standards
        adaptatation to
            changing base projects
            changing technologies
    types of operations
        test based
        generator based
yaml based
automates basic file stuff that I do every day
part of what motivates me is bogus
    I still don't have my basic projects designed yet
    once I do, no telling what will happen
types of projects
    each of three IDEs
    polymer
    svg
    netbeans UI
    electron
    jhipster
        micro
        monolith
    springboot
    swagger
    jenkins
    deploy to docker
        carina
        aws
        local
        other future
    environment variables
    what is the driver
        production
        experiment
        core
        blue/green
        release version
        what other files are or are not there?
            example always a
                readme
                jenkinsfile
                .project
                .yml
                parent folder(workspace)
        manual processes
            done already
            todo and waiting
            discovered by file existence such as jhipster
    settings.xml
    this is probably already all done by chef automate
    atlassian bug stuff
    hooks to external tools always preferred
    docs
        readme
        note
        blog link
        twitter link
        g+ link
        etc
        how to video links
        tooling links
    tie back to central.yml
    dockerize any maven project
    finalname any pom
    .gitignore
if it really is going to be done automagically
    needs to be camel based for file inspection
    needs to be drools based for after file inspection
    needs to defer to jenkins for deployment whenever possible
    needs to run selenium periodically - is site still up?
    needs to write back to god file and keep god file committed
look for duplicate files
take care of my text files somehow
keep track of my archiving pictures
    and give me a way to sort the 10% that I want to protect
maintain resume especially all the technology I have mastered or dealt with
probably atlassian api stuff
probably everything open source same project
maintain minimum project standards for me
maintain as few languages as possible
everything swaggger based
