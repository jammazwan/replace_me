projects on the github/jammazwan site are ready to use before they are committed. This app is an exception to that rule.

This app is not ready for anything, most especially consumption. 
This app is in a conceptual stage only. 
It is only on github as a repository. 

It may take months before this app begins to take shape - as in sometime in 2017.

### replace_me

An app for replacing me, or as many of my functions as can be automated.
