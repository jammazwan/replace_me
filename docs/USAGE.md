This project is a Jammazwan project - thus it is defined as a way to learn Apache Camel.

Usage of this app would by necessity start with customization. You would fork the project, and then customize everything to match your own daily work. "Everything" in this context means just that.

This project would probably start with a youtube demonstrating my own usage. Then you would begin migrating your own usage piece by piece.
